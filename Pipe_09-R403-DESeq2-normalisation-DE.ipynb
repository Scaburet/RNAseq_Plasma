For genes with lower counts, however, the values are shrunken towards a middle value. The VST or rlog-transformed data then become approximately homoskedastic (more flat trend in the meanSdPlot), and can be used directly for computing distances between samples, making PCA plots, or as input to downstream methods which perform best with homoskedastic data.  \n",
    "> **Which transformation to choose?** The VST is much faster to compute and is less sensitive to high count outliers than the rlog. The rlog tends to work well on small datasets (n < 30), potentially outperforming the VST when there is a wide range of sequencing depth across samples (an order of magnitude difference). We therefore recommend the VST for medium-to-large datasets (n > 30). You can perform both transformations and compare the meanSdPlot or PCA plots generated, as described below.*  \n",
