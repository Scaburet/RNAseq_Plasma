RNAseq bioinformatics analysis course materials for Master's students

This repository contains adapted Jupyter notebooks for RNAseq bioinformatic analysis, specifically designed for second-year Master's students in genetics. The course materials are structured in two parts:

1. Bash analysis pipeline (Pipe00b to Pipe_06 notebook)
2. R analysis pipeline (Pipe_08 to Pipe_11 notebook)

## Development Workflow
This repository uses a feature branch workflow. Please create a new branch for each feature or bugfix.
