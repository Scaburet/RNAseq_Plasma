    "The **pseudomapping** or **pseudoalignement** is an alternative method of counting reads to transcripts and genes without prior mapping to a reference genome. It relies on prior indexation of all transcripts (rather than indexing the genome). Using theses indeces, reads are directly assigned to transcripts. This method does not generate BAM/SAM alignement files. It produces directly the matrix of counts for each transcript.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main advantages of this method is the speed and direct count of all transcript isoforms (only annotated ones). On the opposite, only annotated transcripts can be counted and it does not allow the discovery of new transcripts. It is also impossible to vizualize the alignments of the reads with visualization tools such as IGV.\n",
    "To quantify expression at the gene level, transcript counts can simply be aggregated (i.e summed) by genes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two softwares are currently available with very similar characteristics and outputs, namely [Salmon](https://salmon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html#) and [Kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/). You can find a brief summary of both methods here: https://learn.gencore.bio.nyu.edu/rna-seq-analysis/salmon-kallisto-rapid-transcript-quantification-for-rna-seq-data/. Both methods are higly similar and provide same results (see blog of Lior Pachter: https://liorpachter.wordpress.com/2015/05/10/near-optimal-rna-seq-quantification-with-kallisto/ claming that Salmon copied Kallisto). Nonetheless, Salmon is somehow easier to use., soo we will use Salmon in this pipeline."
